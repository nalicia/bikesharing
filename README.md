In the Tripduration visualization we see that the average bike renter haves between a 10 and 20 minute ride. Evident by the spike seen in dark blue.

The checkout times by gender is our first indicator that the majority of the bike renters are male. Women are the seond largest group trailing far behind the males, and lastly the unknown or nongendered persons. Like the first visualization the average ride is between 10 and 20 minutes.

This visualization has a large amount of information being displayed. The first thing I would like to pint out is, between 4 o'clock pm. and 7 o'clock pm.  citibike sees the most traffic. Based on this we can conclude that there less renters in the early hours of the morning versus the evening.

This visualization shows the trips by gender as well as the time of day renters  go for their ride. This visualization backs up not only that men are more prone to renting but also, the most popular times to rent are between 4 o'clock pm. and 7 o'clock pm.. With this visualization we get a bit more in depth. Here we can see that another popular time period is between 7' o'clock am. and 10 o'clock am. The female side isnt too far off, just with less renters.

Lastly we have the trips by gender per weekday subscriber vs. customer visualization. 
Subscribers are more likely to book a ride on (Friday's ugly sister) Thursdays. There seems to be no nongendered or unknown subscribers. For customers, very few there are, the data tells us Saturdays are the best days for them to give CitiBike a try.
