In the Tripduration visualization we see that the average bike renter has between a 10 and 20 minute ride. Evident by the spike seen in dark blue.

The checkout times by gender is our first indicator that the majority of the bike renters are male. Women are the seond largest group trailing far behind the males (blue), and lastly the unknown or nongendered persons(red). Like the first visualization the average ride is between 10 and 20 minutes.

This visualization has a large amount of information being displayed. The first point I would like to make is between 4 o'clock pm. and 7 o'clock pm. CitiBike sees the most traffic. Based on this we can conclude that there are less renters in the early hours of the morning versus the evening.

This visualization, like the one above, shows the day as well as the time of day renters go for their ride. It also shows the trips by gender. With this visualization we get a bit more in depth. This visualization backs up not only that men are more prone to renting but also, the most popular times for men to rent are between 4 o'clock pm. and 7 o'clock pm on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.  Here we see that another popular time period is between 7' o'clock am. and 10 o'clock am, throughout the week. The female data isnt too far off from the male time and date data, just with less renters.

Lastly we have the trips by gender per weekday subscriber vs. customer visualization. 
Subscribers are more likely to book a ride on (Friday's ugly sister) Thursdays. There seems to be no nongendered or unknown subscribers. For customers, very few there are, the data tells us Saturdays are the best days for them to give CitiBike a try.
